# Grid-Search

This code is a JavaScript implementation of a search algorithm, primarily used for pathfinding in a grid-based environment. The main components include:

A class called Search_Student, which contains methods for initializing the search, performing search iterations, computing heuristics, and checking if actions are legal.
The Node class, representing a node in the search tree, with attributes such as coordinates, parent node, action, cost, and heuristic.
Functions for determining if an agent of a given size can fit in a specified location, computing connected sectors, checking if two locations are connected, and computing the cost of actions.
Implementation of the A* search algorithm using graph search, where nodes are expanded based on their estimated cost plus actual cost.
The code is designed to be modular and customizable, allowing for easy integration with different grid environments and search configurations.
